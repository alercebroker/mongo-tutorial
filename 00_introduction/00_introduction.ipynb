    "\n",
    "[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is a source-available, cross-platform, NoSQL database program. It uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. A NoSQL (also known as non-relational) database uses storage and retrieval mechanisms other than tabular relations. The advantages over relational databases include a simpler design, and easier scaling to clusters of machines, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the programming language used, there are multiple drivers available. In the case of Python (and this tutorial), we'll be focusing on [pymongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo), which is the official driver for synchronous applications and can be installed through `pip`. Check the full list of official drivers [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers)."
