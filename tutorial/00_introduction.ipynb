        "### NoSQL\n",
        "Although relational databases are the most widely used tool for managing data today, this does not mean that they are the only solution available. An objective of relational databases is to allow the modeling of any use case through tables, which makes them very general. On the other hand, there are many more specific contexts where one does not need all that the relational model offers. Furthermore, in a highly specialized context, using a relational database may be less efficient precisely because of the generality of the relational model.\n",
        "To address this problem, the NoSQL paradigm was born (from non-SQL, or Not only SQL)\n",

        "|  | SQL | NoSQL |\n",
        "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
        "| Model | Relational | Non-Relational |\n",

        "### Distribution\n",
        "Databases typically store data centrally, which compromises the scalability of the system to process high volumes of data. In this sense, Distributed Systems provide a powerful tool, although they cannot guarantee consistency, availability and partitioning at the same time (See [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem))\n",

        "### Data Models\n",
        "NoSQL models are various, and generally try to balance the complexity of operations they support with the size of data they can handle efficiently. Among the most popular are dictionary-based databases, column families databases, document databases, and graph databases.\n",

        "### MongoDB\n",
        "\n",
        "[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is a source-available, cross-platform, NoSQL, Document database program. It uses JSON-like documents and stores in the form of [BSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON).\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the programming language used, there are multiple drivers available. In the case of Python (and this tutorial), we'll be focusing on [pymongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo), which is the official driver for synchronous applications and can be installed through `pip`. Check the full list of official drivers [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Warning:** During this tutorial we'll be connecting to a MongoDB instance with version 6.0 (the latest at time of writing) and using pymongo 4.3.3. As MongoDB is usually updated, there might be some features here that won't work with older versions or that might have somewhat different behaviour depending on the version of the MonogDB instance we'll be connecting to. During this tutorial we'll try and point out the most egregious incompatibilities, but it is not within the scope to handle all of them, so be mindful of the error messages you might receive during regular use.
