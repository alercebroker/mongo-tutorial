    "New concepts seen here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indices allow for better performance over queries that involve indexed fields, preventing a full collection scan\n",
    "* Projections allow us to limit or rename the number of fields returned\n",
    "* Expressions allow for more complex queries, not just direct comparissons with the values, but also over operations involving one or more fields\n",
    "  \n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some operators might ignore certain types of indices. If you see a loss of performance, check the `explain` method and documentation to make sure things are being used as expected\n",
    "* Queries over arrays are sometimes unintuitive. To ensure that the query matches for a single element, use `$elemMatch`. Otherwise the match might be over different elements\n",
    "* Geospatial indices and searches works somwhat differently than others and the latter cannot be done without the existence of the former"
