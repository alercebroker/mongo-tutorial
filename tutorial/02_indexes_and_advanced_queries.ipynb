    "## Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is used to make searches more efficient. When there are no indices, any search goes through each full document in order to find the specified results. If a search uses indexed fields, it can perform more efficiently by going only through the indexed field(s), and then retrieving only the matching documents without having to go through the full collection. However, not everything needs to be indexed, since the storage usage can grow substantially when too many indexes are created. It is generally recommended to limit the number of indices to the most commonly used fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this tutorial, neither the gain in search speed nor the extra storage required will be noticeable, but for large collections this has to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every collection in MongoDB comes indexed by `_id` by default, but new indices can be created at any time and there are different kinds of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If your user doesn't have write permission, you won't be able to create your own indices, but the gains when doing queries over existing indices will still be noticeable.\n",
    "\n",
